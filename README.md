# one-chain
minimal blockchain ever.

Assist you to develop blockchain core easily.
> [2018 OSS Grand Developers Challenge Award](https://project.oss.kr)   
> Based on the following code: [lhartikk/naivechain](https://github.com/lhartikk/naivechain)   

## Abstract
![structure](https://github.com/twodude/onechain/blob/master/images/structure.png)

As Blockchain-based service grew, so need of open source which assists developing blockchain core was drived.
Although there are some open source projects like Bitcoin and Ethereum, those are too difficult to learn and to use.

You can solve the above problems by using
**```one-chain```, simple implementation of blockchain core.**
The one-chain adopts modularization design: Dividing layers into blockchain, network, APIs, and wallet to achieve clarity.
Also, detail comments and documents are provided for studying and easy reusing.

Both front-end and back-end of one-chain is written in Javascript (Node.js and Vue.js) but also written in a pseudo-code style to provide understanding by other language developers.

# How to Start

## Environments
- Node.js v8.11.3
- cURL 7.55.1 *or* Postman v6.4.4

## Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
## Run Nodes

### Start node #1
```bash
npm start
```

### Start node #2

* Set HTTP_PORT for HTTP communication

  ```$env:HTTP_PORT=3002```
  *or*
  ```export HTTP_PORT=3002```

* Set P2P_PORT for P2P communication among peers

  ```$env:P2P_PORT=6002```
  *or*
  ```export P2P_PORT=6002```

* (*option*) Set pre-connected PEERS before running

  ```$env:PEERS="ws://127.0.0.1:6001[, ws://127.0.0.1:6003, ...]"```
  *or*
  ```export PEERS="ws://127.0.0.1:6001[, ws://127.0.0.1:6003, ...]"```

* (*option*) Set PRIVATE_KEY where private_key is located

  ```$env:PRIVATE_KEY="second"```
  *or*
  ```export PRIVATE_KEY="second"```

  Now private_key is located in `./wallet/second/` instead of default location `./wallet/default/`.

```bash
npm start
```

### Get blockchain
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blocks
```

You can use 'pretty-print JSON' for better readability:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/blocks | python -m json.tool
```
Python >= 2.6 is required.

### Get a specific block

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/block/:number
```

For example, let's get a block whose number (index) is 3:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/block/3
```

### Add new block
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data "{\"data\" : [\"Anything you want\", \"Anything you need\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:3001/mineBlock
```

### Get connected peers
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/peers
```

### Add peer
```bash
curl -H "Content-type:application/json" --data "{\"peers\" : [\"ws://127.0.0.1:6002\", \"ws://127.0.0.1:6003\"]}" http://127.0.0.1:3001/addPeers
```

### Get Address
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/address
```

### Create Wallet
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/createWallet
```

### Delete Wallet
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/deleteWallet
```

### Stop
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3001/stop
```

# one-chain explorer
![explorer](https://github.com/twodude/onechain/blob/master/images/explorer.png)

**`one-chain explorer`** is the front-end for the blockchain explorer which is used to visualize the state of the blockchain. You can see the latest blocks and details about a specific block via blockchain explorer.

As you know, one-chain already has multiple functions with HTTP (RESTful API) endpoints. So a web page just calls those endpoints and visualizes the results.

The whole UI codes are located in `./explorer/`. Vue.js and Vuetify are used to implement.

# How to Start
```bash
cd explorer
npm install
```

## Run

**Requirements:** there must be at least one running node whose `HTTP_PORT` is `3001`.

```bash
npm run serve
```

Now app is running at http://localhost:8080/ by default. Using 'Chrome browser' is recommended.

# How to Use

* You can search a specific block by block number. Type in the search bar or click the `BLOCK #N` button.

* Turn on the 'Realtime Updates' switch at the top of page if you want to get blockchain in real-time. It will send `/blocks` GET requests to full-node to get blockchain in every 2 seconds.
